***Pushing***

Description = pushing files from local repo(local machine) to remote repo(github)
	****The file structure of git****
		You have files in your local machine or local directory. After you makes changes to file(s), there are a few steps
		to push the changes to your remote repo. First changes are added to the index(staging area). Then commit the changes to the
		head. At this point, committed changes are not in your remote repo. You have to push them to your remote repo.

if(want to add all files to the index)
 {	
	type git add * (add all files to the index)
	
} else{
	type git add filename (filename = the file name you want to add to the index)
	
}

type git commit -m "message" (message = any messages you want for the changes you've made) to commit changes to the head.
type git push origin master to push head to remote repo
